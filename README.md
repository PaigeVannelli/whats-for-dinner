- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events

## Technologies Used
- Javascript

- html

## Set Up and Instructions
To view the code, please go to the GitHub repo (https://github.com/PaigeVannelli/whats-for-dinner).

## Functionality

A random dish is returned to user based on the dish type input. Once the let's cook button is clicked the dish will be displayed on the right hand side.

Users can also choose to display a randomly generated entire meal by clicking the entire meal input on the form. Users must check a valid option before clicking the let's cook button, otherwise it returns an error message.

Once a meal or dish is displayed, users can then clear the displayed meal using the clear button.

User can add their own dish to the recipe options by clicking the add recipe option. A form appears where the user can then enter a type and name of their recipe. The recipe is then displayed on the screen. If a user enters an invalid recipe type, it returns an error message.
